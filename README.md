### NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER

- Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images, a Content Image and a Style (Reference) Image and blend them together so the output image looks like the Content Image, but “painted” in the style of the Style (Reference) Image

### WORKFLOW OF NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER

- Importing Libraries
- Loading and Pre-processing the Content Image and Style (Reference) Image
- Loading the Pre-Trained Model ("http://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2")
- Visualizing the Result
- Storing the Result
