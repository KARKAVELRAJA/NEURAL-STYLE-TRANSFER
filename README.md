### NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER

- Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images, a content image and a style (reference) image and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style (reference) image

-----

### WORKFLOW OF NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER

- Importing Libraries
- Loading and Pre-processing the content image and style (reference) image
- Loading the Pre-Trained Model ("http://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2")
- Visualizing the Result
- Storing the Result
